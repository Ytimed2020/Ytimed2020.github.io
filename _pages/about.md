Have a happy day! 😊

I am Yudong Yang, an undergraduate student currently working as a Research Assistant at the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), under the supervision of Lan Wang, Nan Yan, and Rongfeng Su.

Prior to joining SIAT, I gained valuable experience through internships at leading companies and institutions, including Sensetime, Xbotpark Robotics, and as a visiting student at SIAT.

My research interests lie in speech AI, speech LLM, and multi-modal learning.
